"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!

"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.

"OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star.",OMG DO NOT BUY!!!

"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better.",Weird flavors....
"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better.",Caveat emptor! Disappointing
After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!,Not Safe!
"I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the ""sampler"" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or ""the lack of variety"" pack!",Disappointed!!
"I used to buy Bob's Red Mill Organic 7 Grain Pancake & Waffle, Whole Grain Mix until I saw all these rave reviews about StoneWall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix. I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.<br /><br />This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7"" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.<br /><br />In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach.",Disappointed with my first farmhouse pancake
"Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors, got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee, much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes, I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors, I would have ordered such!<br /><br />On the up side, the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise, don't waste your money!",VERY Unsatisfied

"I bought this same brand from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products.  I was able to turn it into cream/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah brand of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless.",Little Flavor
This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.,Terrible
"The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a ""helpful review"", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself.","Beware, if you have a corn allergy!!"

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",Kitty Junk Food
"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>",All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!

"So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.

"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.","Not bad, but not good either"

"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good.",Poor Food Design!!!
"I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just can't eat gluten.  With that said, this is nasty.  It calls for very little sugar, I figure for the health nuts, so I simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  Even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  I would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  On a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund.",Simply Nasty
"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.

Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.

"I've eaten Claxton Farms fruit cakes for over 40 years and love them.  I thought I'd be smart and order 5 one pound cakes at once as I know I'd use them.  This time the quality control went out of town.  Lousy.  Absolutely disappointing.  Of the 5 loaves, one was good,  Two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and I ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping,  totally unable to slice.<br /><br />the last two loaves just the opposite, they were runny.  When taken out of the wrapper they just flopped over, again, had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes.<br /><br />Claxton Farm might have sold out or fired the Quality Controller.  Awful quality after all these years.  Do NOT order from Claxton as you don't know what you'll get.  They lost a long time customer with me.",What happened to Claxton Farms Quality???
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",A Big Ripoff!

"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.

"These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.<br /><br />I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.<br /><br />I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies.

"I was familiar with a few of Wolfgang's recipes before I tried any of his soups. First I tried a different flavor a year ago, but can't remember anything except it being bland and slimy.  I decided to try it a 30 minutes ago because I was desperate for something healthy and convenient because I was a tad sick and could not make my own unprocessed meal with the ingredients I had home. I bought it for about $3 and hoped I just had a bad can of soup the first time, but this was just awful. No taste, slimy, and hardly any chicken (probably 3-4 tiny pieces). I can see why they added such little chicken. It's just tasteless and dry; tasted nothing like chicken. I'll go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better. This sure didn't do it. I have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning.

"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time.

OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.,Pork Rhinds Origional Flavor
"After reading all the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb (somewhat low calorie) snack that I can work into my low carb living.  I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars.",You have to be really desperate

"The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen ""ice"" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.<br /><br />Years ago ""Grecian Delight"" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.

I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/brownie baker",Nice and Waxy

I threw them all away which made it a complete waste.  I would have tried to rescue the paste earlier by putting it in plastic tubs and freezing or SOMETHING.  BTW, the expiration date on the unopened tubes was 16/11/2012.

"I have been trying the sample sizes of a bunch of different protein shake mixes. I am glad I got the sample size of this one as it is the worst of the lot so far. It tastes super bitter, although, I did not mix fruit with it like the directions say, so perhaps it would be better with fruit. It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.<br /><br />Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein.

"This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!

I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.",A Protein Powder to make you Gag.

The product that I purchased was soggy and greasy like it had been in the sun for awhile. It also tasted like it was rotten meat product. There is no use by or best by date on the package so I do not know how old it is either. I do not recommend this product.,"Nasty, I can not recommend"
"These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.

I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products.

"This is the worst low-carb product I have ever purchased.  When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible.  I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor.  I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful.  I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement.  I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible.  I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market.

This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe.

It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again.",yucky
"Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.

"Spearmint Lifesavers have been my favorite for many years, and I've been buying them in bulk from Amazon because they're so hard to find in stores. I just opened a new shipment today and ate one, and it tasted terrible!  I thought perhaps I had received a different flavor by mistake, but when I looked at the label, it said ""spearomint.""  Then I noticed ""New & Improved Flavor."" What a joke.  The old flavor was delicious, and this one tastes just awful. This isn't just a minor difference.  There's no spearmint flavor at all, just a chemical taste and even worse after taste.  The ingredients are the same (sugar, corn syrup, natural flavor, stearic acid), so it must be the ""natural flavor"" which doesn't taste like anything natural to me. I have one old roll left, and I guess I'll have to really savor the flavor I love for the last time.",Not the same! Taste is awful now!
"I bought this coffee because I have acid reflux/GERD.  It says it is coffee and it is low acid.  I made three pots in a very good coffeemaker and nothing I did improved the flat nothing taste of this coffee.  It also was no better for stomach irritation that other coffees I have tried.  I took a chance when I bought this coffee because it is non-returnable.  I have spent less money for much better tasting coffee.  Amazon seldoms disappoints me with the quality of their products.  Healthwise Gourmet Coffee, is something I would have been better to do without.",Low acid and no flavor
This product makes it sound healthy having 50% whole grains in the pasta however the part that everyone should be aware of is the 3.5g of trans fat. Trans fat is chemically made to prolong the shelflife of products and it is not good for ur health. Eating this each day is unhealthy due to the enormous amount in each serving. I suggest buying one that contains 0 or at minimal .5g trans fat if u must.,Whole grain with trans fat

"My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it!

This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up.",Slimy and disgusting

"After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!",Poor Quality Product - Recall should be issued!
"My son LOVES HappyBellies Oatmeal, so I tried the Multigrain and he loved it, too. So did I, until I read the ingredients and noticed that they added glucose to make the cereal sweet.

I don't know how these were stored but they arrived in mid-April when temps in Chicago the entire week before had ranged from the low 30s to the mid 50s, but they'd obviously been subjected to much warmer conditions. The shells were soft and kind of sticky and with none of the usual Lindt gloss, and the fillings were almost the same texture. The taste was barely adequate but the texture was not even close to what it should be even if you'd bought them off a grocer's shelf and a number of them even had dents in the shells although so far none seem to have been completely melted.<br /><br />If you can buy them directly from Lindt in the middle of December, you'll probably be ok.

We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice.

"Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.","If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash"

When you taste these you only get the taste of salt. Either the package I got came from the batch Amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt.

"I purchased this coffee because of the claims on the packaging that the beans were picked with integrity and with fair practices. I always look for these traits in my coffee, as well as look for organically grown beans. I also always purchase decaf and love strong, dark roasted coffees. So, I brewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high-end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I brewed it the same as I always brew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole brewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to bring this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put-downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored. I will never buy this coffee again and want to spread the word to my family and friends to stay away from this coffee as well based on my experience.",Very bitter coffee.  Rude customer service!
"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor.

"I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.",Moldy meat.

If this disgusting sludge makes me a trendsetter I fear what would not make me a trendsetter. Tastes terrible and comes in packaging that insults my intelligence.

"I bought this from Amazon, and it came with two containers as if it was packaged for Costco.  The packaging was pretty, and the tea smelled and tasted great.

"We tried this product, a bunch of us. And we are all vegetarian. We also do not like onion or garlic; one of the friends esp. is sensitive to this.

In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.<br /><br />  We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list ""spices"" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not. After all the comparisons, we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste, quality and texture.<br /><br />  In fact, they are out of Teriyaki, their best selling jerky, the original flavor, peppered and hot n' spicy.

"This is the kind of garbage ""food"" that gives paleo/primal a bad name.<br /><br />Whenever you see the words ""Gluten-Free"" on a product label, you should immediately be skeptical.  99% of the time you'll want to run away SCREAMING at the top of your lungs.  'Cause it's not only about gluten, it's about blood sugar spikes.  If you care about your pancreas (which you can't live without), and not becoming (or staying) diabetic, you should care about this.<br /><br />Look at the ingredient list:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Manioc (Tapioca) Flour, Modified Manioc Starch (100% Manioc), Iodine-free Sea Salt, Basil, Garlic, Onion, Oregano. Manufactured In A Gluten-free Environment. Allergen Information: Contains No Wheat, No Soy, No Corn, No Rice, No Potato, No Yeast, No Nuts, No Peanuts, No Lactose, No Casein.<br /><br />Those first two ingredients are garbage carbs you don't want to eat no matter what.  Tapioca starch will spike your insulin faster than a Snickers bar... faster, even, than two slices of whole wheat bread.  No need to investigate further.<br /><br />But say you're still curious. Let's go to the Chebe website.  Here's where the real tale is told:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The box contains 10 servings, at 18 grams each - HOWEVER, you use THE ENTIRE BOX to make one pizza crust!  That's 180 grams of pure, processed carbs with zero nutritional value in one 14"" pizza crust, which is only a medium size pie.  The other ingredients you add to the crust mix are negligible carb-wise (but you still look at them): 2 eggs=1 gram, 1 cup shredded cheese=0 grams if you grate it yourself from hard, aged cheese (the pre-grated store cheeses are coated with potato starch and do add some carbs), 1/4 whole milk=2.5 grams, oil=0 grams. So 3-ish grams are added to the pie.  And now let's say you top it with tomato sauce, part-skim mozzarella and some veggies (since a pizza isn't just a crust).  Even without calculating precisely how much you're using, it's a good bet that you are adding another 30 or so carb grams.  Thus, your medium pizza pie will have 180+3+30 grams of carbs, or 213 total.  You eat half the pie, that's 106+ grams of carbs.  If you're trying to lose weight, that's more than two DAYS worth of carbs.  If you're trying to keep your blood sugar stable, you just blew that, too.<br /><br />To lose weight eating grain-free, the rule of thumb is no more than about 50 carb grams per day, no more than about 15 net carbs (carbohydrate-fiber=net carb grams) per sitting.<br /><br />And that's how you evaluate a ""Gluten-Free"" label.  Or, you could buy the product, make it, test your fasting sugar with a glucometer right before eating, then again an hour later to see firsthand what it's doing to you.  The average healthy, non-diabetic person will zoom from about 90 to 160 within an hour; then it will take another several hours after that to get back down to around 100.  Do that once a day (or several times per day) for a few years, and your problems will be over - because then you can start injecting insulin into your belly with a syringe before each meal and eat whatever you want!  And once again, the ""food"" industry and Big Pharma win.  To me, that's just sad, and the antithesis of paleo/primal eating.<br /><br />I love pizza.  I eat it all the time.  AND I eat a low-carb/high-fat diet.  In a few months, my triglycerides went from 261 to 87, and I'm no longer pre-diabetic.  That never would've happened if I were preparing meals using commercial mixes like this.  There are dozens of reputable low-carb, grain-free recipe blogs and websites out there with pizza crusts made from cheese, eggs, flax meal, nut flours, cauliflower, or even just sausage (Meatz Pizza) that are just as easy to make as this one from a processed mix, that hew to the spirit of paleo/primal eating and are far healthier to boot.",Care about your health?

However, I am VERY disappointed with this last shipment I received. There is a pronounced reduction in quality... watery milk with large gritty chunks of fat. No creaminess at all. I see from the other recent comments that other customers have experienced the same disappointment.<br /><br />The lower price and BPA-free cans become less attractive when you are receiving a sub-standard product... especially a case of it. I'd rather pay more for the other brand I purchase, Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk, and get a higher quality product.",Quality Unacceptable... used to be better
"I have liked this product in the past but the contents of every can in this shipment (twelve in all) was thin and curdled and had a peculiar grayish cast.

It has a lot going on...grain wise, I think just about every kind of grain on earth is mixed in.  Which I guess is ok, if your into that type of thing.<br />3.  The taste just isn't worth the effort (it doesn't have any taste, you could be chewing on anything grainy and textured) and it would also be beneficial if the would make individual packages for easy portion servings otherwise I can't imagine why someone would make an entire pot full of this stuff??<br /><br /> I typically like whole grain, low sugar type hot cereal but this is a little too earthy for me, however, clearly some people enjoy this type of thing but it is not for everyone.",Expired and too grainy!

"The Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea used to be my favorite tea- it was naturally sweet so I never had to add any sugar or honey. However, after receiving my current shipment of tea, I noticed that the taste was significantly different than the taste I was used to- the tea just didn't taste very good at all. I couldn't figure out why until I read some recent Amazon reviews mentioning that Good Earth was recently purchased by another company, which must be using inferior ingredients. Such a shame. I appreciate Amazon's great customer service- I received a full refund- but unfortunately had to cancel my subscribe and save subscription.

I called Amazon and they were sincerely apologetic and sent me another case.  Unfortunately the same thing happened.  I didn't bother calling this time.  I was afraid they would think I was scamming them.  I think between the 2 cases(12 boxes) I got 5 boxes of cones if you took all the damaged ones out.

I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo.

You quote Stanley Burrough's statement in his book of why he recommends your specific product:<br /><br />""From page 17 of The Master Cleanser by Stanley Burroughs:<br />""... maple syrup is a balanced form of positive and negative sugar and must be used, not some 'substitute... The maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins. Naturally the mineral and vitamin content will vary according to the area where the trees grow and the mineral content in the soil. These are the minerals found in average samples of syrup from Vermont: Sodium; Potassium; Calcium; Magnesium; Manganese; Iron; Copper; Chlorine and Silicon. Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, Nicotinic acid and Pantothenic Acid are also present in the syrup... Some uninformed operators of the sugaring of the maple syrup do use formaldehyde pellets, run through polyethylene tubing but there are many more that don't. Search out and demand the kind that does not use formaldehyde. Maple Valley Syrup (formerly Maple River Valley) from WI. does not use it. This is the kind I recommend.""<br /><br />but you don't advertise that specifically, anywhere. Obviously, now-a-days, you DO use formaldehyde.

"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business.

First of all, this product is tiny granules that are much darker than the Prince of Peace product.  When mixed with hot water, rather than being a lovely gold, it is a brown.  The first taste was awful and I mean really awful.  My friend added some sweetener to hers thinking it would be an improvement, but it was an unsuccessful attempt.  I felt the lemon flavor overwhelmed the ginger flavor, yet there was some heat from the ginger that tried to come forward.  The flavor was extremely unbalanced and tasted more like the taste of a lemon which has been cut and stored in the refrigerator, turning brown and developing a rancid flavor that creeps into the nose.  My friend held her nose and drank her half cup but I could not force mine down.  Instead, I gladly drank the other beverage.",A rare review for me

"Purchased 5 of these since my local pet store was out & I've never had a problem with it in the 6 -7 years we've been growing cat grass - specifically this brand. Bought it as a Christmas gift for the cats. Planted seed from first package, very skimpy germination. Figured, OK one package may be bad, no big deal. Planted again from a different package, same result. Remember - we've been growing this cat grass for years using the same type of soil in the same type of pots w/out a problem.<br /><br />Contacted the seller about the issue & no dice, too bad - since it was literally a few days past the 30 day no questions asked return policy. Of course it took additional time for the seller to reply to my initial email but they would not take that into account either.<br /><br />So - went & bought the exact same type & manufacturer of grass seed at the pet store & guess what?

"Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess.

It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting.",Bad Product Update

I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink.

"So, what happens when Coca-Cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste? It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.<br /><br />Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying ""I told you so"" ever since this version was released.

"This bottle looked exactly like the front label that is on a current bottle of Hollywood safflower oil I have. They do not show you the back label where it states amt. of polyunsaturated fat (only 2 when needed 7+), or any other info. In my opinion, this is deceitful. Are they trying to taking advantage of those looking for the safflower oil that Dr. Oz refers to on his show. I believe it is why they don't show the back label, but just the front. Amazon and all vendors of this and any other food product should show all the information, front and back labels. I am so disappointed in Amazon that I can't say I would purchase from them again. I now have three bottles of safflower oil that will not be used and I am out $20+ because it cannot be returned. ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT GET THE CLA FROM COSTCO made by Trunature. IT IS MADE WITH PURE SAFFLOWER OIL. I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND IT WORKS. It is about $20 for a bottle of 160 or 180 softgels. I just thought I could get something a little cheaper.

"The very 1st thing I noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted!

"I should have known when I touched these strips.<br />They are rock solid hard.<br />Anyways I gave it to my dog for the first time, and it caused minor tearing and ulcers in her GI tract. I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-",Treat caused ulcers in my dog's GI tract

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.","Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more"

"Let me begin by saying that I really really like Bear Creek Soups!! Best on the market as far as a dry soup mix (in my opinion) BUT they really missed the mark on this one.

"One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it.

Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.

Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.

So when I saw these ""Cream Crackers"" on Amazon, I was overjoyed.  To my utter disappointment these crackers are not anything like the cream crackers I have eaten in central and south america.  These crackers are extremely dry and bland.  They taste like you took an unsalted three day old dry biscuit and compressed it into a cracker.  There not light and flaky like the cream crackers I have eaten for 20 years.  What a disappointment!  I also tried the Lyons brand sold here on Amazon.com and they are just as bad.  Both are made in the UK, so that might explain it.  You will find Mexican food restaurants and Brazilian food restaurants, because they know what taste good.

Cook your own from fresh (try a Southern favorite and make a squash and cheese casserole with a Ritz cracker topping!

I'd rather say something else (regular white sesame seeds?) are mixed in. Even after roasting, the aroma is not nearly as good as those unroasted decent black sesame seeds I had back when I was in China. Most importantly, the flavor! Those seeds are bitter and I dare say, you must put tons of sugar to barely cover the bittness.

"Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!",A nighmare dealing with this company

"Over the years I have eaten MANY ""health"" bars, fiber bars, protein bars, etc.  I usually eat a protein bar a day, and I am very used to the chalky texture and taste of protein bars and have learned to overcome them.  The Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bar is not a protein bar, but tastes almost as bad as that. Correction, it tastes, worse than a protein bar.  There is no real chocolate taste to it at all, and the protein chunks that are in it taste like these cheap almond pieces they used to shove into candy bars 30 years ago, way too small to offer any real taste.  Actually, they taste just like the nuts you get in brownies. I love almonds, but hated the taste of these. I forced myself to eat three of these bars so I could give them an accurate review, and that was extremely difficult.<br /><br />The selling point of Pure Bars are that they are made with natural, whole ingredients and are vegetarian and gluten-free.  As someone who is trying to avoid High Fructose Corn Syrup and added sugar, I like that, however it doesn't do me any good if I can't enjoy the product enough to consume it.  I know some reviews have claimed that these are ""health bars"" and that they have too much sugar, but they are not marketed as a ""health bar.""  Too many people confuse the ideas of ""whole"" and ""natural"" foods as ""health"" foods, which is entirely not the case. The idea is that these bars are for people who don't want additives and a lot of over-processing in their food, it's just unfortunately that they taste so bad.  If you're looking for a better-tasting alternative, I'd suggestion the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00199KYSO"">-  Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Variety Bars (All Natural) - 24 ct.

"Here's a review by someone who is not fat, not on a diet, and who has not ruined his palate with fat free confections:<br /><br />These are the worst brownies I have ever tasted!  My wife bought this mix because it was the only one available at Trader Joe's when she shopped.  She didn't tell me they were fat free, but as soon as I tried one, I knew.  It had all the hallmarks of fat-free baked goods - gummy, flat, and the chocolate tasted like cocoa powder, not like rich fudgy chocolate.  I almost had to spit it out, it was that awful.<br /><br />And do you want to know why fat free foods taste so bad?  I'll let you in on a little secret:  the secret ingredient in good-tasting food is... you guessed it - FAT!!!!!  Fat and oil molecules transport the lovely taste of foods onto your taste buds.  So stop being so afraid of fat!  A little bit won't kill you!  Just exercise a little self-control and don't eat the entire box.  One properly made brownie is more satisfying than a whole plate of these vile things.<br /><br />So if you like real food that tastes good, don't believe the reviewers that raved about these brownies.  These people have a hidden agenda - they are trying to convince themselves that these little nuggets of evil actually taste good and are good for them.",These brownies are horrible

However, though Armour owns up to making many less than healthy edibles, on their website, there is NO mention of Lard as one of their many products.<br /><br />If you have to use Lard, this is a long established brand that resturants use, and though ""hydrogenated"", this is a good product as hydrogenated Lard goes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I wince when I leave a resturant, and while walking through their parking lot find myself staring at huge tubs of empty lard containers lying around the dumpsters.

In fact, when the box came in the mail, I raced to open it so I could try out these little gems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I expected to be a favorable experience turned out to be terrible.<br /><br />My first taste of these nuts was like having orange pith (the white part between the peel and the orange) fried in oil, doused in a vat of salt and sugar and dipped in black pepper.  There is virtually no cashew flavor left in these little nuts.<br /><br />I love cashews.  I have eaten them raw and roasted in many ways for years.  This experience with Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews was an assault on my taste buds.<br /><br />The salt with citric acid combination is terrible.  When you combine it with the maltodextrin AND sugar, the cashew flavor is corrupted beyond recognition.  Then adding the black pepper makes it even worse.  A handful of these *nuts* is like dumping a salt shaker in your mouth.  It is almost repulsive.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are pretty greasy as well.<br /><br />I am very sorry that these cashews were treated this way.<br /><br />I would have preferred the graceful simplicity of simple roasted cashews with a DUSTING of sea salt and black pepper over them- nothing more.  The sugar and maltodextrin ruin this mix- and the addition of citric acid makes the finish quite bitter.  I do not like these at all.<br /><br />If you love sweet things and don't mind bitterness and a mouth full of salt, you might enjoy these.

I probably should have done it beforehand, but when I tasted this I HAD to check the ingredients.  Yes, they did indeed not only pepper the cashews, they also added onion powder.<br /><br />Sooo...

I have tried pouring a truly excessive amount of it onto my food, and I simply cannot taste the difference between food without Cholula and food with Cholula, and it's not about the heat or spiciness, I tend to be just fine with Tabasco or any other ordinary sauce. Finally I tried this on it's own, and all I can taste is vinegar. Then I thought, well, it must be organic or all great ingredients, but that's not the reason for the higher price either, there's plenty of artificial flavors and colors in here.  So the hype here is really about the bottle.

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",Kitty Junk Food

They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.

Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: ""Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled ""Bad"" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives.""<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!",Bars were moldy!

"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.

"As an omnivore with a 100-200 gram daily protein intake, I am always looking to diversify my protein sources.  For protein supplements, I find the best value at Costco when purchasing Cytosport whey protein that costs approximately 2.2 cents per gram of protein.  Yet, it gets boring eating from the same six pound bag for months.  So, I recently evaluated two vegetable-based protein supplements: Nutribiotic Rice Protein and Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, both with chocolate flavoring.  While the Rice protein has great economics, tastes fantastic and contains few carbs, this hemp protein fails in all three categories.<br /><br />When I initially tasted Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, the first thought that came into my mind was ""is this product really suitable for human consumption!?""  Olfactory memories from large-scale grass cutting arose.  Even with the rich dark chocolate, I can't consume this protein straight or even mixed with milk.  The pungent taste needs to be blunted with large amounts of cinnamon and Splenda and/or mixing with high protein cereals such as Kashi or Special K.<br /><br />Another undesirable aspect of this protein includes the large amount of carbohydrates:  2.1 grams for every gram of protein. The economics are underwhelming as well.  It costs about 10.8 cents per gram of protein versus 2.7 cents per gram for the Nutribiotic Rice protein or 2.2 cents per gram of protein for the Cytosport offering at Costco.<br /><br />Cons<br />Terrible taste<br />High carb content<br />Poor economics<br /><br /> Pros<br />Rich dark chocolate flavoring",Awful tasting protein partially masked by rich chocolate - 4x as expensive as rice protein alternatives

I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!

"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.

"I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.","Bad Packaging, Great product but can't recommend shipping"
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now.  I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.  Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water. My mother in law sealed the container and took these pictures I have contacted the company but I have yet to hear from anyone.",Vita Coco Buyers BEWARE- Mold inside
"Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog ""treats""??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole ""Likety Stik"" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the ""Likety"" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the ""Stik"" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say ""ewwww get this thing outta my face right now""!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit.",Pointless dog treat
"This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing.",BUYER BEWARE

"Don't feed Rawhides, they are unhealthy.<br />Sadly, rawhide bones are very dangerous to dogs. While some dogs go their entire lives scarfing down the fun-to-chew treats, they can be deadly. Rawhides can be full of bacteria and poisons. Aside from what is in rawhide, dogs can choke on them or sustain intestinal blockage from ingesting them.<br /><br />Rawhides often come from less developed countries. This means that the hides are transported over poor roads and without refrigeration, before they cleaned and dried. Under these conditions, they can grow salmonella which can kill your dog. It is also unsafe for humans, especially small children, to handle. The problem has been so serious that in 1999 the FDA to issued a warning on the subject stating ""These products may pose a risk of bacterial infection such as Salmonella...FDA is urging pet owners who have these products to handle them carefully. Anyone who comes in contact with these treats should wash their hands with hot water and soap. Elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk from exposure and should avoid any contact with these chews.""<br /><br />Read up.",Unhealthy

"I will start with some helpful info..<br /><br />-Nespresso machine: Pixie<br />-Ne-Cap capsules 100 pcs.

Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price.

"My family used this product for over 4 years, but last year the recipe was changed, sugar was added. That decision was probably driven by Cascadian Farm's desire to increase profits (cheaper production, more appealing to mainstream sugar junkies). Unfortunately, there aren't many choices right now for nutrition-conscious individuals. Even the so called organic/health cereals are loaded with sweets (all sorts of syrups, juice concentrates). Starting a morning on that note sets you up for a roller-coaster ride of high-low blood sugar. I had nothing else to do but to start cooking whole grain cereals (oatmeal, millet, buckwheat). It takes a bit of planning - you have to allocate time for cooking in the morning or cook the nigh before, but in the process you can save a ton of money. For instance, a pound of organic millet costs from $0.99 to $1.79 depending on the retailer (or $0.06 to $0.11 per oz). In the process of cooking grain absorbs water and increases it mass at least 3 fold. That makes the price of cooked cereal go down as much ($0.02 to $0.04).  Compare that to $0.48/oz price for Purely'Os! Then maybe the recipe change introduced by Cascadian Farms is truly a blessing for your wallet, if you are willing to wait 20 minutes, while you cereal is boiling on the stove. This time is not lost, but gained - you can use it to practice sun salutation to make your morning even more glorious!",Terrible mistake! (or maybe not?)
"3 years ago we looked long and hard for a sugar free, whole grain finger food for our then 6 month old.  Our son enjoyed this cereal as a snack and until recently, as a cereal, but then I bought my most recent box and noticed right away they didn't look the same.  When I tasted one I immediately knew they were sweetened and sure enough, when I checked the nutrition label it showed 3g of sugar per serving.  The label is completely unchanged except for the ingredients and this is dangerously misleading.  We live in a country where diabetes is rampant and sugar can be very dangerous.  How frightening that they Cascadian Farms/General Mills would sneak sugar into their cereal without changing any of the main labelling.  I will never buy anything from them again!",Sneaky and potentially dangerous change
"I've lost all respect for Cascadian Farm in recent weeks for taking our favorite cereal bar none and turning it into junk overnight - this cereal had been our staple for half a decade since our son was a baby (now he's almost 5), because it tasted great and had no added sugar.  I found it when specifically looking for a cereal without the sugar, and it fit the bill for years.  Then suddenly a week ago our son said it didn't taste right and refused to eat it and I looked at the box and while nothing else on the box had changed the ingredients certainly had - I had one leftover old box and the old ingredients were whole grain oat flour, whole grain barley flour, wheat starch and sea salt, and the new ingredients are whole grain oat flour, corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, wheat starch, sea salt, tapioca syrup, molasses (i.e., they have now added corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, tapioca syrup and molasses and removed whole grain barley flour).  It's completely misleading - the new box has a picture of the old Purely O's, but the new cereal looks completely different from the old one, even though the picture hasn't changed. Now we're stuck with cereal we won't eat and can't return because it's opened.  I contacted the company to complain and asked where I could get the old formula and their response was not helpful - they didn't answer the question of where to get the no-sugar version and the response was pat - i.e., they were sorry to hear of my disappointment regarding this reform and would share my thoughts with the appropriate individuals.  This is so misguided and a perfect example of large companies getting into the organic business and managing to end up serving us junk by another name; the old product was quality, the new one is one to avoid.  While boycotting an entire company's product line is not typical for me, I am leaning toward refusing to buy ANY of their products any longer due to this change and the company's response to my inquiry; I can't in good faith buy from them when other companies are acting more responsibly.","bait and switch - used to be great, now it's junk - AVOID THIS CEREAL"
"I *loved* that Cascadian Farms used to sell an organic version of that perfect baby finger food - Cheerios. We bought it often, but were surprised and saddened to see the latest version sneaks in added sugar.

Of course, he's still a fan, but I will not be buying these again unless CF reverts to the old (perfect!) formula.","old version was 5 stars, new one sneaks in sugar!"

I try to make sure that the products I consume are not only good for me but pleasantly flavored.  I did not find Vita Coco to be the latter.  The water was slightly sour and it was a real chore for me to finish a 17 ounce container.  I had to brush my teeth after drinking it because the aftertaste was strong.<br /><br />I love almost all things coconut but Vita Coco's beverage is not one of my favorite coconut based products.

I have ordered VITA coconut water 17oz pack and the taste was pretty bad. Most of the bottles smell and taste stale. Couple of the bottles were decent but not as good as ZICO or ONE.

"This is the biggest waste of money and scam I have seen in a long time. Raw, organic coconut oil is definitely one of the healthiest additions you can make to your diet.

We LOVE velveeta in our household but unfortunately today I opened a box of broccoli rotini and there was no cheese sauce or broccoli pouch.

This would have been OK or SO-SO if they had used regular pasta. I'm feel like the other reviewers that the broccoli was more of a dust than chunks.

"Saw this on Oprah's favorite things and thought it would make a great little Christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as I do. Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem.

"Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market (""good source of electrolytes"")?<br /><br />I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.

No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.

"This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.<br /><br />The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.<br /><br />Not recommended, sorry.","Didn't like the flavor, aftertaste, or quantity"

"This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.<br /><br />I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.<br /><br />For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.<br /><br />Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans.",cloying

The other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out.<br />I still have about thirty left, and when they are gone I will not replace them.",Not worth the trouble
I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better.<br />There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry,black truffles
"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one.",Nothing special
"First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.

"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable.",barely any vanilla aroma or flavor
"I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though.",Really Disappointed

"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others.",Bitter taste
I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.,No flavor - very weak

The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.,Lawrey's Microwave Pork rinds review
"I considered buying these but the health risks should be considered.<br /><br />These are cured, stored with salt, and have nitrates.<br /><br />If you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns.<br /><br />you can still eat well when avoiding such things.",What about health?
"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore.",Keurig Hot Chocolate Pods
"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.",Too Much Sugar!

I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).  It didn't taste like the original but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and so I will not be ordering it again.  This tea did not have the strength or zing of the original.  I'm upset still.,Unfortunate mistake
"Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.",Ok for an expensive treat; not for a supplement
"My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand.",Not Sure
"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""

"It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old.  I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for.",Bad Batch of dog biscuits?
The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits.  It was weird ......  they just weren't solid like they should be.  I'm going to switch to another brand of grain-free dog bisquits now as there's no sense in paying for something I'm not getting (and these are expensive!)  And if it wasn't for the good packaging I'd wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I don't think that's possible.,Some of the bisquits were hollow-not solid as they should be

"I recently did a taste test with my family between two store bought pizza sauces. Pastorelli and Don Pepino. They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left.",Not sure why all the hype

"I order a 6-pack of large dog chicken pill pockets every month.  The vendors vary; I buy from whichever vendor offers free shipping.  The last time I ordered, the pill pockets were all crumbly and torn inside the packages.  They weren't dried out; they were just torn up.  I had to mush our meds onto the pill pockets and mash shreds into a ball to get enough to cover the meds (my dog takes about 5 pills per meal, poor baby).  Anyway, every pouch was the same way.  I made sure to order from a different vendor this time even though it's hard to see how the vendor would be at fault for the product.  Regardless, I've never seen this before and I hope not to see it in my next shipment; if I do, back they go!",A quality control issue maybe?
"All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)",dark meat
